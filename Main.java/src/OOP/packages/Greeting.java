package OOP.packages;

public class Greeting {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world");
    }
    public static void greeting(){
        System.out.println("I am awesome");
    }
}// if want to create another class of same greeting it will not create of same name as already existed
// to overcome this issue we can do it by using the packages by creating another package inside a package we can crete same name classes in both packages
