Stack Memory:

Stores local variables and reference variables (i.e., memory addresses of objects).
The stack is automatically managed (data is pushed and popped as functions are called and returned).
Limited size, can lead to stack overflow if too much memory is used (e.g., excessive recursion).
Heap Memory:

Stores objects and class-level (non-local) variables.
Memory in the heap is managed by the Garbage Collector in Java, which automatically frees up memory no longer referenced by any part of the program.
Larger in size than the stack, but slower to access due to the dynamic memory allocation and garbage collection overhead.
Summary:
Primitive types are stored on the stack when they are local to a method, but if they are part of an object, they are stored in the heap along with the object.
Reference variables (pointers to objects) are stored in the stack, but the objects themselves are stored in the heap.

//The stack is used for storing local variables and function call-related data (such as function parameters, return addresses,
// and local variables).
